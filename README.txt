== API Key Required ==
The API key for TheMovieDB is referenced in res/strings.xml:

    <!-- TO BE REMOVED BEFORE PROJECT SUBMISSION AND REPLACED BY REVIEWER -->
    <string name="themoviedb_api_key">CODE_REVIEWER_API_KEY</string>

I understand that storing sensitive materials in Resources is poor form with regard to security, but for the sake of this demo project it seemed sufficient.
